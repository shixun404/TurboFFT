# TurboFFT

## Overview
TurboFFT is a streamlined and efficient Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) implementation specifically designed for NVIDIA GPUs. Emphasizing both minimalism and performance, TurboFFT's core is comprised of less than 300 lines of code. Despite its compact size, it delivers FFT processing capabilities that are on par with or surpass those of NVIDIA's cuFFT library.

## Key Features
- **Lightweight Design:** With less than 300 lines of core code, TurboFFT is exceptionally lean, making it easy to integrate and maintain.
- **High Performance:** Engineered for speed, TurboFFT matches or exceeds the performance of the industry-standard cuFFT library.
- **NVIDIA GPU Optimization:** Tailored for NVIDIA GPUs, TurboFFT leverages the full potential of their parallel processing capabilities.

## Applications
TurboFFT is ideal for applications requiring high-speed FFT computations on NVIDIA GPUs, such as:
- Signal processing
- Image processing
- Scientific simulations
- Data analysis
